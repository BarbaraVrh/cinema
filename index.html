        <div class="text"> Many years after the reign of Caesar, a young ape goes on a journey that will lead him to question everything he's been taught about the past and make choices that will define a future for apes and humans alike. The new Apes movie is set many years after the conclusion of 2017's War for the Planet of the Apes. Many apes societies have grown from when the Moses-like Caesar brought his people to an oasis, while humans have been reduced to a feral-like existence. Some ape groups have never heard of Caesar, while others have contorted his teaching to build burgeoning empires. In this setting, one ape leader begins to enslave other groups to find human technology, while another ape, who watched his clan be taken, embarks on a journey to find freedom. A young human woman becomes key to the latter's quest, although she has plans of her own.

        <div class="text">Luca Guadagnino directs “Challengers,” a time-shifting drama about a love triangle between tennis pros, as if he’s a top-seeded player so ruthlessly focused on winning Wimbledon that he’d run over his grandmother if she got between him and the stadium. Every shot is a serve, every montage a volley. There’s even part of one match done from the point-of-view of a ball being smacked to-and-fro at high speed. It’s extravagantly goofy. But it’s also hilarious and wonderful, because it’s an objective correlative for how far the film will go to entertain you.

        <div class="text"> Julie and Tristan are lovers who are about to get married. Hoping to get a beautiful card reading, they end up receiving an awful reading from a Tarot card reader. According to the opened cards, someone is coming from the past to take one of their lives. Tristan doesn't believe in the reading, but Julie can't get her mind off it because of the guilt she's feeling toward her twin sister, Sofia, who was born with a disfigured face. Sofia ended up committing suicide because she was jealous of Julie's beauty. And so Julie begins to feel restless. She has nightmares, she gets bruises when she wakes up, and visions of her twin sister, which she keeps on having, convince Julie that Tristan and her are in danger. The Tarot card reader says there is nothing they can do and so the terror gets out of control.They are unable to get away from the Tarot reading.
